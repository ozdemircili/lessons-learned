# lessons-learned
We all learn by time and by the situations we encounter. On the ther hand I always had a feeling that we were loosing those lessons learned that are so valuable that I wanted to collect them in a big repository where we can all add our experience and help the rest.

Be kind enough to pull request and add your lessons learned.
